This is an implementation of Wavelets based on SigPack, a great wrapper of Armadillo, engine of Matlab and Octave. Is made in C++ and is very easy to use, portable, and fast.

SigPack
=======
SigPack is a C++ signal processing library using the Armadillo library as a base. The API will be 
familiar for those who has used IT++ and Octave/Matlab. The intention is to keep it small and only 
implement the fundamental signal processing algorithms.
