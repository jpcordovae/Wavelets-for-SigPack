SigPack
=======
SigPack is a C++ signal processing library using the Armadillo library as a base. The API will be 
familiar for those who has used IT++ and Octave/Matlab. The intention is to keep it small and only 
implement the fundamental signal processing algorithms.

Known Issues
============
The Gnuplot functions worked well under Windows and RedHat distributions, however in Ubuntu you might
have to change the gplot.h file as:
        gnucmd = popen("gnuplot -persist &> /dev/null","w");
to
        gnucmd = popen("gnuplot -persist","w");
Also you need to use the gnuplot-x11 version:
         sudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11
